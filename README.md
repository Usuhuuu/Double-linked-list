## Description

This program is a **menu-driven console application** written in C++ to demonstrate the operations of a **doubly linked list**. A doubly linked list is a data structure consisting of nodes where each node contains a `data` field and two pointers:
- A pointer to the **previous** node
- A pointer to the **next** node

The user can perform multiple operations interactively through the terminal.

## üîß Features and Functionality


### 1. Insert at Beginning
- Inserts a new node as the **first element** of the list.
- If the list is empty, both `head` and `tail` point to this new node.
- If not empty, updates the `left` pointer of the current head.

### 2. Insert at End
- Inserts a new node at the **end** of the list.
- If the list is empty, initializes the list with the new node.
- Otherwise, updates the `right` pointer of the current tail.

### 3. Insert at Position
- Allows inserting a node at a **specific position** in the list (1-based index).
- If the position is `1`, it's the same as inserting at the beginning.
- Traverses the list to find the correct location and links pointers accordingly.
- If the position is invalid, prints an error message.

### 4. Delete from Beginning
- Removes the **first node** of the list.
- If list becomes empty, both `head` and `tail` are set to `nullptr`.

### 5. Delete from End
- Deletes the **last node**.
- Updates the `tail` to the second last node.

### 6. Delete at Position
- Deletes a node at the given **position**.
- Adjusts surrounding nodes' `left` and `right` pointers.
- Edge cases for deleting the first or last node are handled.

### 7. Display Forward
- Prints the contents of the list from **head to tail**.

### 8. Display Backward
- Prints the contents of the list from **tail to head**.

### 9. Exit
- Terminates the program.

## Program Structure

| Component         | Purpose                                                                 |
|------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `struct Node`     | Defines the doubly linked list node with `data`, `left`, and `right`.   |
| `createNode`      | Dynamically allocates memory for a new node.                            |
| `insertAtBegin`   | Inserts a node at the beginning.                                        |
| `insertAtEnd`     | Inserts a node at the end.                                              |
| `insertAtPosition`| Inserts a node at a specific position.                                  |
| `deleteFromBegin` | Removes the first node.                                                 |
| `deleteFromEnd`   | Removes the last node.                                                  |
| `deleteAtPosition`| Deletes a node from a specific position.                                |
| `displayForward`  | Traverses and displays nodes from `head` to `tail`.                     |
| `displayBackward` | Traverses and displays nodes from `tail` to `head`.                     |
| `main()`          | Menu-driven interface that takes user input and calls functions.        |
